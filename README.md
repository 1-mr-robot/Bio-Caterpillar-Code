# Bio- Inspired Caterpillar
The Bio-inspired caterpillar project was developed to mimic the movement of an organism in nature. The mini-project was the first ever Arduino project our team developed and we were declared the best mini-robot in our cohort.

As part of the presentation, our team demonstrated motion on the ground as well as created a ladder kind of environment to simulate the vertical ascent of the caterpillar.
